                Harry Potter's life is miserable. His parents are dead and <br>
                he's stuck with his heartless relatives, who force him to <br>
                live in a tiny closet under the stairs. But his fortune <br>
                changes when he receives a letter that tells him the truth <br>
                about himself: he's a wizard. A mysterious visitor rescues <br>
                him from his relatives and takes him to his new home, <br>
                Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. After a <br>
                lifetime of bottling up his magical powers, Harry finally <br>
                feels like a normal kid.
