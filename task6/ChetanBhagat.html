                The 3 Mistakes of my life is the third novel written by
                eminent Indian Author Chetan Bhagat. Based on cricket,
                business and religion, the novel is set against the
                backdrop of beautiful city Ahmedabad. Revolving around
                three young Indian boys Omi, Ishaan and Govind, the
                book goes on to narrate how the three are trying their
                best to make ends meet in the city. Based on real events,
                the book starts with a dramatic twist, where Bhagat is
                reading an e-mail sent by some young person Govind.
